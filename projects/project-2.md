summary: This is about when I was a Team Manager/Coach for a MISO team.
---

MISO stands for Major Island Soccer Organization. It is one of the competitive soccer leagues here on Oahu.

I was the Team Manager/Coach of Team XI in MISO's 3rd Division. It was only for 1 season, and then our team disbanded. Though we lost every game, I loved it. Being a coach, going to the meetings, doing the paperwork, it was a blast. Though I didn't get paid, and actually lost a lot of my own money, I wish one day I could do it again. I learned a lot of what went wrong that season, so if I were ever in that situation again, I would be better prepared.

At the end of the season, I dont remember the exact details but I remember we were dead last. That was not the reason why we disbanded, but it didn't help when deciding if we wanted to play again the next season.
