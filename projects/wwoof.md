summary: Back in 2014, I took a semester off of school and went WWOOFing.

Early 2014, I didn't go to school like all my other friends, and instead I went to England to wwoof. If you don't know what WWOOFing is, here is a link to there website: http://www.wwoof.org.uk/
I don't want to go into details on what WWOOFing is, but I will talk about my trip. Firstly, you can wwoof almost anywhere, but I chose to go to England for many reasons.
There at England I met with 3 different farmers all in different parts of England: York, a small town near Leicester, and New Forest (near Southampton).
I don't have a real interest in farming, but this trip was more so I get out of my comfort zone, and away from Hawaii.
It was a real challenge at first because this was winter time and so it was really really cold. I lived in Hawaii my whole life so I wasn't use to that kind of temperatures.
Anyways, it was really fun and definitely what I needed in my life. I would totally recommend it to someone else, but beware of feeling homesick at first.
