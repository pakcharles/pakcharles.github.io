Hello friends and strangers!

Configuration management is a important part of building anything, and in software configuration management it is extremely important. It isn't always possible to work together in one room. Some people don't like crowds, some projects require 100's of people, some people code better at night while others code better during the day. So with all that said, here comes the idea of Configuration Management. When you are working on projects with other people you have to rely on each other to get the job done. So I believe it is extremely important that the project has good configuration management.

Though it is weird that I said all of that earlier. I myself have never had software configuration management experience. But I did have group projects in high school, as I'm sure we all have. The concept is the same, or at least to my understanding it is the same. When my group had communications problems, it was a struggle man. Especially in like freshman year, cause like you start getting grouped with people you don't know from different middle schools. Senior year though, group projects were the best. I am assuming that my first couple group projects will be a struggle, but maybe after a couple of them I will learn good configuration management skills. Right now, I would be a disaster to any group, because I have no clue on how to use git. Barely even know how to use GitHub haha. 

Is GitHub popular because of git, or is git popular because of GitHub? I can see cases made for both sides, but here is my opinion. I think that git is popular because of GitHub for one reason. prior to making this essay, I had absolutely no clue what git was. Even now, I don't truly understand it. In my other ICS classes we used GitHub for file sharing and stuff, so that is what I thought GitHub was originally for, a giant file sharing website.

Don't get me wrong though, I can see why people think GitHub is popular because of git. I want to bring up an example that relates more to me. Back when I was in middle school, MySpace was the social media website everyone used. No one used Facebook, or atleast at my middle school. But then one day I saw a friend playing this game, Farmville, on a website I never heard of before, Facebook. I wanted to play to, so I made a Facebook account. Then Facebook had another game, Restaurant City. Next thing you know, I stop using MySpace and started using Facebook. Like it happened so quickly, because for those games, the more friends you had, the better it was for your farm/restaurant and so all my friends started to add each other and next thing you know, everyone is on Facebook.
