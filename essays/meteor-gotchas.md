Intro

Para 1
  When I first started using Meteor I finally understood why professor Johnson insisted we had a really strong laptop for this class. I was struggling really bad the first week because my computer would take ages to create an app, then to run the app. It was so bad that I was seriously considering about replacing my laptop, which I haven't even had for over a year yet. When I would watch Professor Johnson do the initial set up for our assignments, his computer would take no more than 5 minutes to get everything rolling. To do those same task, my computer would take near 20 minutes. It was absolutely fustrating. Instead of showing my fustration to others, I converted my anger into jokes, and pretended it was funny to my fellow classmates.
  During one of the of the assignments, I believe in particular it was the in class assignment on March 28th, I forget what it was called, my computer totally just pooped out. I don't know what the source of the problem was, but after I ran the meteor app, it would just keep crashing with exit code: '1'. Looking around the Internet for solutions to my problem, I found out that if I uninstalled meteor and reinstalled, that would fix my problems. So I did that, gave the assignment another shot after class, and again my computer crashed with exit code: '1'. Not knowing what to do my I asked my friend if they could help. He didn't know what the problem was either, but he suggested that I switch over from Windows OS to a Linux OS. I used Windows my whole life, so I had no clue what to expect, but I knew that if I did nothing, my computer would keep trolling me. So I switched over to Linux, in particular Ubuntu, and I redownloaded everything and tried it again. Surprisingly, all my problems went away.
  First thing I noticed was that my initial runtime was expontentially quicker than before. I was able to set up everything close to Professor Johnson's time. Most importantly, my program stopped crashing with exit code: '1'. The initial learning curve is really hard if you switch from Windows to Linux for the first time, but if you are having similiar problems to me, I highly suggest giving Linux a try. There are many different types of Linux, my friend suggested I use Ubuntu because it has a semi big community so if I had any issues, I could find a solution myself online.
Para 2
  A problem I have yet to solve about Meteor is, the learning curve. Meteor can be so simple, yet it can be so complicated.
