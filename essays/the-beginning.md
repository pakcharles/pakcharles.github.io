Hello reader, welcome to my little world.

Its the spring semester of 2017 and my schedule is packed with all sorts of classes. One that stands out in particular is ICS 314,
or better known as Software Engineering. To be quite honest, I have no clue what to expect from this class. I don't even know what
software engineering is. If I had to guess, this class is going to be about making websites. Here is what I do know: 1. This class
is a Writing Intensive class, which is what I need. 2. This class is listed as a requirement to graduate.

After the second week of the semester, this class seems like it is going to be really challenging. I still don't know what it means
to be a software engineer, because all we have been doing is building an online presence. Well actually, we also have been doing 
these things called WODs which are actually fun. WOD stands for Workout of the day. In this class, when we do WODs, we aren't going
outside and doing 10 laps, but instead we are at our computers, and trying to write code to a prompt while trying to beat the clock. 
I could do without the pressure but nonetheless WODs are fun. 

Since these WODs are timed it makes me very nervous. I am usually a calm and laid back person, but when doing WODs time goes by so
quickly. If we don't finish our code by the time given, we get what he calls DNF status which basically translate to 0 points. He 
does give us a lot of practice WODs that aren't graded, but it isn't the same when they are timed. If any of you play basketball, you
know that making 10 free throws at practice and making 10 free throws in a game are totally different situations. No matter how many
free throws you make in a row at practice, when the lights are on, and the crowd is there, it is a totally different world. But
hopefully as the semester goes on I can learn to be clutch and spit WODs in my sleep. Thats the dream.

Going forward I assume we will be making an open sourced project, because our professor keeps talking about how important they are
for our resumes. He keeps mentioning them, so it makes me feel bad that I don't have any yet. Everyone has to start somewhere right?
Hopefully by the end of the semester I will have atleast one.

Looking forward to writing a follow up entry later during the semester. Until next time, peace!
