Prior to this past week, my knowledge of HTML was very minimal and my confidence for HTML was rock bottom. Then when I was introduced to UI Frameworks, in particular Semantic UI, my knowledge stayed at somewhat of the same level, but my confidence went through the roof.  UI Frameworks are absolutely amazing! Sure, I totally agree that UI Frameworks are complicated to learn, but man oh man are they worth it. Though I have only been learning HTML for two weeks, so I would still consider myself a novice at HTML, I felt so powerful. Like honestly, in my mind, I had the image of Kevin Garnett during the post-game interview when the Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals.

With anything in life, nothing comes free. Yes, learning to use a UI Framework does require effort and time, but to be honest, it is not much. There will be times where you will be banging your head on your desk wondering why it isn’t doing what you hoped for, but most times that is fixed the moment you realize you misspelled “div”. What I love about UI Frameworks is that feeling of almost instant gratification. You don’t have to type much code, and you can build a decent looking website in under 30 minutes.
