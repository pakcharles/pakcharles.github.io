I just read an essay from Eric Raymond called "How to ask questions the smart way". I was always told that there are no such thing as silly questions, but I never liked hearing that. Then people would say, there are no silly questions, just silly people asking questions. I don't like hearing that either. I think some questions can be considered silly, and Eric Raymond highlights a lot of ways to make questions "smart questions." 

We as people, especially software engineers should try to ask smarter questions all the time. If we ask smarter questions it just makes
everything so much more easier for yourself and the people who want to help you. If we ask smarter questions, then the reader doesn't have to waste time trying to understand your question. The person who asked the question will most likely get responses quicker, and more likely to get the answer they were looking for. When asking questions, if you keep it too broad then you will get a wide range of answers. On the other hand, if you had a precise question, then you will get a precise answer. Its just purely more efficient.

Here is a question I found on stackoverflow that I thought was a good question. Here is the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array. I think this is a great question for many reasons. The title of his question is very precise. It seems a little open ended, but it truly isn't. In his body for this thread, he puts up code on a test he attempted and showed others that he put in some serious effort himself first. Though this part doesn't really take that long, he tried his code in one language and then another to see if that matter any. Like take me for example, I am not that proficient in C yet, so I didn't really understand his code, but because he did it in Java as well, I could follow it.

Here is a question I found on stackoverflow that I thought was a bad question. Here is the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21068763/forcing-a-function-to-return-if-false. I don't like this question for a numerous number of reasons. First, this question looks like its a homework question. If you look at his code it is really hard to follow. Looking at his question, it looks like he was looking for the syntax on how to use a While loop. Now I don't know about you, but I learned about While loops WAY before I learned about addresses. So either this guy forgot what a While loop is, or he copy and pasted this homework from the Internet elsewhere and is trying to learn someone else's work that seems hard to follow.

Honestly... before reading Eric Raymond's essay, I knew there was a difference between smart and silly questions, but I could never describe it. I always just looked at the question, and could tell. Now instead of telling someone that they have a silly question, I will link Eric's essay and hopefully the person will learn a few things or two.

Side note, asking smart questions also is good because you don't want to become the next Internet meme. There is this guy on Facebook, and he makes videos of people on the Internet asking silly questions. I think his videos are really funny, but it is depressing how many videos he makes. Like it makes me wonder, is our world doomed? Anyways, let us all make a promise to ourselves and try to ask smarter questions from now on!
