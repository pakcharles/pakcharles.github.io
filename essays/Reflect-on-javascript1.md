Hello everyone, I am Charles. Today I want to talk about my ICS 314 class.

Its only been two weeks, but because of this class I have learned a new language called Javascript. I am a complete newbie to this language. It has a lot of similarities to Java, but it seems to have less syntax rules, which I absolutely love. Including this language, I have 3 languages under my belt: Java, C, Javascript. Between the three, I like Javascript the best. As of now, I believe Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective, but that is because I am still new to the scene, so please don't flame me.

As for ICS 314, the class itself, I am liking it. We have this thing called athletic software engineering, and it is pretty fun. We do these things called WODs which I think stand for Workout of the Day. The practice WODs are really helpful, especially the AmyWODs. This is a completely new style of learning to me, but I do not like the stress I get from it. Being timed when coding is really stressful, because when I code, what feels like 2 minutes is actually 15 minutes. So, when I am doing the actual WODs that are graded, half of my brain is praying I don't DNF while the other half is coding. Hopefully with more practice throughout the semester I start to ease up and just approach the WODs comfortably. I think as long as I just keep doing them, it will be fine.

This was my review of ICS 314 as of now, looking forward to writing more about this class in the near future. See ya!
